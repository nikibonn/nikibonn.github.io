    <h1>Mah4l na Mah4l keta. Cheer up! You can get through this <3.</h1>
    <p>"And anytime you feel the pain, Hey Jude, refrain,
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making her world a little colder." - Beatles</p>

and that's ok. She doesn't have to force herself but i want to remind her that i'll 
alwaays be heree when she needs me :)). Hehe i hope that my actions somehow give her a sense of 
warmth.</p>
